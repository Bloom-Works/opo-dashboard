    title: Performance Tier (2019)[1](#sources-1)
    source: Tier rating via [CMS](https://qcor.cms.gov/main.jsp), was released in
      September 2021 based on most recently available data from 2019. OPO names
      are listed as by CMS, with the exception of Donor Network West (formerly
      California Transplant Donor Network), OurLegacy (formerly TransLife) and
      We Are Sharing Hope SC (formerly LifePoint).
  rank:
    title: OPO Rank of 57 (2019)[2](#sources-2)
    source: OPOs ranked by CMS Standardized Transplant Rate. 2019 data released by
      CMS September 30, 2021. (See [CMS Quality Certification and Oversight
      Reports](https://qcor.cms.gov/main.jsp), linked to OPO Public Performance
      Report on left.) Legacy of Life (Hawaii) is excluded from CMS organ
      transplantation rate rankings due to “geographic challenges of the OPO
      servicing the Hawaii DSA”  which led to CMS using “the kidney
      transplantation rate for only the OPO serving the Hawaii DSA.” (See [CMS

      rule](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/112020-opo-final-rule-cms-3380-f.pdf).)

      an OPO failed to meet Tier 1 standards, according to CMS. Each missed
      transplant results in a loss of life because an organ was not available.
