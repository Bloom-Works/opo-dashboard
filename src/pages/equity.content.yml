  heading: PATIENTS OF COLOR ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO NEED AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT THAN
    WHITE AMERICANS AS A RESULT OF INFERIOR SERVICE FROM OPOS
  description: >-
    Patients of color are less likely to receive organ transplants than white
    patients because of inferior OPO service. We must drive reforms to hold OPOs
    accountable.


    See our report cataloguing peer-reviewed research on the inequitable service OPOs provide to different ethnic communities. As bipartisan, bicameral Congressional leaders have written, OPO reforms have “urgent implications for health equity”.

  steps:
    - heading: Patients of color are less likely to be referred as potential organ
        donors to the OPO than white patients
      description: This results from differential OPO practices and resource
        allocation for communities of color, including that OPOs spend fewer
        resources on hospital development in communities that serve patients of
        color, and sometimes even as as the result of specific “guidance by OPOs
        to not call on specific circumstances to avoid reporting on cases when
        the OPO believes donation is unlikely [overwhelmingly more commonly for
        patients of color].”
    - heading: OPOs are less likely to respond to donation referrals for patients of
        color versus white patients
      description: >-
        “One comparison study that looked at differences in organ donor
        experiences found Black families were “less likely to have spoken to an
        organ procurement organization representative,” with previous research
        concluding “[t]he odds that a family of a White patient was approached
        for donation were nearly twice those for a family of an African
        American.”


        Dr. Kenneth Moritsugu, Former U.S. Surgeon General: “Often, misallocation of OPO resources means OPOs do not respond to all donation cases, or do not properly train and support their frontline staff. The impact of this, unsurprisingly, falls disproportionately on families of color.”
    - heading: OPOs provide less complete and compassionate care to families of color
        versus white families
      description: >-
        When OPOs do follow up with the families of patients of color, the
        quality of the interaction is often inadequate. A study comparing
        experiences between Black donor families and white donor families found
        Black people experienced “less complete discussions about the
        possibility of organ donation.”


        Another study found the most common reasons Black families declined to donate were that the OPO did not “give [them] enough time to discuss important issues… or respond to strong emotion with sensitivity and empathy.”


        This is a missed opportunity, since families who spend more contact with OPOs are shown to be 3 times as likely to donate.
