  quote: The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the need for organs now and
    creating an urgent health equity issue, as communities of color are
    disproportionately impacted by the failures of the current organ donation
    system and the effects of COVID-19.

  heading: Patients of color are far more likely to need an organ transplant than
    white Americans as a result of inferior service from OPOs
  description: OPOs are less likely to respond to donation cases involving
    patients of color versus white patients, and have been shown to spend less
    time with these families and to provide less compassionate service. This
    leads to fewer lifesaving organs available for recipients of color - and the
    COVID-19 pandemic is only exacerbating these disparities.

    - heading: Patients of color are less likely to be referred to the OPOs than white
        patients.
      description: This results from differential OPO practices and resource
        allocation for communities of color, including that OPOs spend fewer
        resources on hospital development in communities that serve patients of
        color, and sometimes even as as the result of specific “[guidance by
        OPOs](https://bloomworks.digital/organdonationreform/Inequity#fn:28) to
        not call on specific circumstances to avoid reporting on cases when the
        OPO believes donation is unlikely \[overwhelmingly more commonly for
        patients of color].”
    - heading: OPOs are less likely to respond to donation referrals for patients of
        color versus white patients.

        “[One comparison study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12545008/) that
        looked at differences in organ donor experiences found Black families
        were “less likely to have spoken to an organ procurement organization
        representative,” with [previous
        research](https://bloomworks.digital/organdonationreform/Inequity#fn:32)
        concluding “\[t]he odds that a family of a White patient was approached
        for donation were nearly twice those for a family of an African
        American.”


        Dr. Ken Moritsugu, Former U.S. Surgeon General: “Often, misallocation of OPO resources means OPOs do not respond to all donation cases, or do not properly train and support their frontline staff. The impact of this, unsurprisingly, falls disproportionately on families of color.”
    - heading: OPOs provide less complete and compassionate care to families of color
        versus white families
      description: >-
        When OPOs do follow up with the families of patients of color, [the
        quality of the interaction is often
        inadequate](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/07/09/dont-let-the-covid-19-crisis-delay-reforms-to-our-organ-transplant-system/).
        A
        [study](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Abstract/2003/01000/Comparison_of_black_and_white_families_.23.aspx)
        comparing experiences between Black donor families and white donor
        families found Black people experienced “less complete discussions about
        the possibility of organ donation.”


        [Another study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40615-020-00806-7) found the most common reasons Black families declined to donate were that the OPO did not “give [them] enough time to discuss important issues… or respond to strong emotion with sensitivity and empathy.”


        This is a missed opportunity, since families who spend more contact with OPOs are shown to be [3 times as likely](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40615-020-00806-7) to donate.
