  opo-performance: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) ranks OPOs
    into 3 different tiers based on their performance. Rankings incorporate the
    number of donors and the number of organs transplanted. The majority of the
    nation’s OPOs are failing to meet Tier 1 standards, leading to thousands of
    unnecessary deaths each year, which disproportionately harm patients of
    color. The map below shows the current ranking of U.S. OPOs by location,
    based on the most recent data available (2020). [Find more information

    Axios](https://www.axios.com/organ-donation-recovery-worse-people-of-color-8d42a213-4ef7-48a3-85fb-dd15cfc4301b.html):
    "Fewer Black donors correlates to fewer Black recipients, which has led to
    more Black dying on the organ transplant waitlist."'
  congressional-investigations: >-
    The House Oversight Committee is investigating 17 OPOs for “shocking
    mismanagement”, among other conflicts and abuses. In parallel, the Senate
    Finance Committee is also conducting a bipartisan investigation into the
    federal contractor UNOS for “the inadequacy of UNOS’ oversight of OPOs”
    despite “lapses in patient safety, misuse of taxpayer dollars, and tens of
    thousands of organs going unrecovered.” Bipartisan leaders of both House
    Oversight and Senate Finance have called to accelerate reforms as an “urgent
    health equity issue.”

      since 2017—in addition to other undisclosed influence spending on law
      firms and public relations advisors—apparently designed to stop or weaken
      the proposed changes.
